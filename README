Introduction
------------

This library provides a generic interface to indexed corpora. An indexed
corpus consists of a data file and an index file. The data file is a
concatenation of chunks of data, such as XML documents or compressed
derivation trees. The index file contains names for each chunk, along with
the offset and size of the chunk encoded in base64 format.

This library is part of the Alpino parser. This standalone version is
provided for reuse convenience.

Design
------

Nearly functionality is modelled as C++ classes using RAII, meaning that
memory is managed by virtue of construction/destruction. Where necessary,
errors are reported as exceptions. Language-specific wrappers can catch
exceptions and translate them to the language's native error reporting
method.

Compilation
-----------

Requirements

- A C++ compiler.
- A C++ standard library with TR1 extensions.
- Qt version 4.6 or later.

Execute 'cmake .', followed by 'make' in the source directory.
