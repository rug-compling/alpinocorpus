Introduction
------------

This library provides a generic interface to XML treebanks. An XML
treebank is a directory structure with XML files representing parser
output, such as dependency structure. Three types of XML treebanks
are supported:

* Simple directory-based treebanks.
* An indexed treebank, consisting of a data file and an index file.
  The data file is a concatenation of chunks of data, such as XML
  documents or compressed derivation trees. The index file contains
  names for each chunk, along with the offset and size of the chunk
  encoded in base64 format.
* Treebanks stored in Berkeley DB XML databases.

Treebanks can be iterated by file or by query result.

This library evolved from the libcorpus library of the Alpino parser,
adding query-based iteration, support for Berkeley DB XML treebanks,
and a Qt-ish API.

ABI/API
-------

We aim for ABI/API stability accross y versions in x.y.z. The C API
(capi.h), Python, and Ruby bindings are not API/ABI stable yet.

Design
------

Nearly all functionality is modelled as C++ classes using RAII, meaning
that memory is managed by virtue of construction/destruction. Where
necessary, errors are reported as exceptions. Language-specific wrappers
can catch exceptions and translate them to the language's native error
reporting method.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for this library can be obtained by running 'doxygen' in
the root of the source archive.
